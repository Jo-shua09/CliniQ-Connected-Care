## Overview:
CliniQ transforms passive health tracking into proactive, connected, and professional-grade monitoring by leveraging full-stack hardware integration, advanced AI and ML inferencing, and an innovative social consent model. It serves both the consumer market seeking good health and well-being and the professional market needing accessible, high-fidelity data.


## Core Technologies Used
- React Javascript Frontend Framework.
- Django Python Backend Framework.
- C++ (Arduino)
- Espressifs Systems SDK for programming of the microconroller.
- KiCAD for the design of the electronics prototype.
- TensorFlow Python ML framework for the building and Training of our custom model used to estimate the Blood pressure.
- [Kaggle Vital signs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasirayub2/human-vital-sign-dataset), the dataset of about 200k records used to train the model.

## Vision & Future Improvements
Our Vision is to make an ecosystem where medical data can be easily acquired, stored and utilized to solve health challenges through ML/AI. We are passionate about making medical tech accessible and cheap so people in remote areas can use it. In doing that we make our Virtual doctor assistant muiltilingual so there is no barrier.

We added more sensory data such as ECG, EMG, Glycometer sensors etc so the system has a more robust understanding of ones health and can make better inferences and advice. We also want to reduce the size of device by designing and protyping a single motherboard for the wearable and a better enclosure.
